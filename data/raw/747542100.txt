Since you have level one pets,id say just keep them stored. Also you can easily get a higher tier one with the pet exchange if you click on your pets

[3:55:43] <iamDaVito> they can kill you
[3:55:44] <Silvervale> There's no flagging for PvP on seasonal servers, except for the PvP one. They declared war on your guild so he can grief you. On normal servers, you can flag and kill people, and each kill costs karma. When you go negative karma its possible to lose enhancements on your gear and lose crystals to player deaths.
[3:55:45] <CCMyLife> They can kill you on pve seasons
[3:55:46] <gyrofive> He can kill you

[5:02:23] <Fossabot> Sodapoppin's discord https://discord.gg/sodapoppin (To be join have sub to not )
[5:02:24] <kittymeowwmeowww> if you're not looting anways you might as well just do pollys on regular servers.
[5:02:25] <llMotionz> might be a nice change of pace
[5:02:25] <i10v> IGNORE THE RETARDS SAYING POLLYS IS BETTER
[5:02:25] <Sainath77> Pollys is the best place for SP, but its also full due that.
[5:02:25] <blveu> dont go to pollys if u dont use pets
[5:02:25] <Tugby02> pollys is best sp in the game
[5:02:27] <Ultramerican> polly's has a 2x multiplier, highest in the game for sp
[5:02:29] <Sauronix> Are you enjoying BDO now? @sodapoppin
[5:02:29] <Godzilla8939> If you're planning on lvling to 62 on quests, there is an upgraded adventurer book, that gives +30% quest exp (it's huge). and quest chain is kinda fun @sodapoppin
[5:02:29] <keleviii> its a bit far but worth
[5:02:31] <Devi_09> @sodapoppin polly gets u good money too
[5:02:31] <YourBoyJohnny> polly's is one of the best for sp

[6:11:31] <CheeriosQ> Imagine dying in PvE when you're at lvl 66 lol
[6:11:34] <BySacred> use 530 scrolls
[6:11:37] <PreDanor_> CHENGA
[6:11:37] <Haydenmango> only 7.2 hours for 0.00001 xp Kreygasm
[6:11:38] <Saurus1> @sodapoppin chenga tome increases quest exp by 30%
[6:11:39] <Darksky7493> SMOrc me smash
[6:11:39] <LidlFrog> FeelsDankMan
[6:11:40] <MasterJoaoPT> I WANNA PLAY NEW WORLD
[6:11:40] <polinska56> if you have 150-200 ap i think you should grind sausans/shultz, it's pretty good skillpoint, exp and money
[6:11:41] <Blakeownz> its a book
[6:11:41] <unboundl> your pets
[6:11:41] <aeranaaa> smash pets to upgrade tiers

[6:11:47] <Grandmaster_Slime> -Õú -
[6:11:48] <BlazeALaFolie> we need VIGGY BabyRage
[6:11:49] <MarkTheStark> press O go to suggested [level53] The Legend regarding the book of chenga tome something like that
[6:11:50] <endjui> he just wanted to smash gachiHYPER
[6:11:51] <orophia> @Herrcookiekiller girl cock ü§§
[6:11:53] <unboundl> How can you not PTW for skill point pets LUL
[6:11:54] <PsycloneXD> Smash PedoBear
[6:11:55] <tienislav> have you tried any other classes?
[6:11:55] <Dano> You combine 2 of the same tier for a chance to upgrade tier basically @sodapoppin
[6:11:56] <Strangypoo> @sodapoppin you probably lose like a week progress if you die and dont tear at that level
[6:11:57] <kaynsirplayer> 3 HOURS FOR 0.00025 gachiHYPER
[6:11:57] <Citrine_Delight> that's how you level the tier up
[6:11:58] <KpSTEEZ> smash them to upgrade
[6:11:59] <iamDaVito> @polinska56 not anymore
[6:12:01] <N0RTV> Have you made your own house yet? LULW <3
[6:12:01] <RedBeardBD> game looks pretty bad at everything really.. fun, mmo style, things to do, party gameplay, pvp, streamability LULW
[6:12:02] <unboundl> Whats another stack for pets
[6:12:03] <overkill_please> u smash the pets together like lvling up gear
[6:12:03] <ShroudedCorpse> Vigors isnt here to translate
[6:12:03] <MarkTheStark> its a questline you get a book that gives you much better exp for questing
[6:12:05] <salatsalat> dont u get more points from higher lvl enemys
[6:12:05] <Addled> @sodapoppin you combine multiple pets or smash them into each other to rank up a tier from 1-4 (4 being highest tier pet)
[6:12:05] <runawaylols> Cheer100 thank you from saving that person from the onion
[6:12:05] <EmptyPackxge> @polinska56 should be over 200ap with all pen tuvala
[6:12:08] <gentasdf> he doesnt need chenga tome chat stop being a Pepega
[6:12:08] <jonax90> I thought you have a taste man this shit is not even worthy of being called a game
[6:12:09] <Blarg> Alright lads, futa or furries
[6:12:10] <T4cticPl4y3r> @sodapoppin u can combine pets to get a better one and they give u buffs
[6:12:10] <kittymeowwmeowww> @polinska56 you're living in a different time, Shultz is 240+ ap now, and sausans are garbage for SP and loot.
[6:12:11] <thisisreso> if you get the chenga tome (just look up a vid honestly) you can quest to lv 61 way faster than grinding

Alright, if you want me to remind you, I have damage dealt by thorns increased by 4 and duration increased by 50 percent - that's a 15 minute buff of a solid 33 nature damage. Not to mention also I've got the balance improved thorns speced increase damage by 75%. That shit will fucking pump. Good luck out-dpsing my buff. It's a godsend.

[11:27:44] <AiryLolicop> literally any pvp bdo player would never say dk is bad @beelzebubvii
[11:27:45] <mucht3rich> nice game AYAYA
[11:27:45] <TekMarkus> @LocusQuo do you see all the timers on the left of his screen? these are all cooldowns
[11:27:45] <ThundaClapMax> To be fair every mmo is p2w nowadays. even classic wow with all the gold buyers and gdkp. BDO is the only one that puts it right in your face and lets you get all the shiny things you want
[11:27:46] <Xibbas> warrior will win 90% of the time vs dk with equal gear even if both are equal skill
[11:27:48] <smoofers> @LocusQuo to the left of soda's character you see the cooldowns pop up
[11:27:50] <Feazur> is this game better than GW2?

[11:28:09] <Roogen_> @LocusQuo yes abilities have cooldown but some are not for use just for the debuff/buff they have. You can spam but just need to wait for cooldown on the stats/effects it gives

[11:32:41] <AntonDan> @Revva1 if I understood correctly stiffen can't be the last cc cause you'll already have reached 2 cc points. So you need to do stiffen first or second so that you reach 1.7 points which is less than 2 and can allow you to do a 3rd cc

[11:51:05] <Thel_1> @Kapinkles Oh for sure dude. Wow is easier to play casually in the short term. But the constant borrowed power resets in wow kill all the investment. In BDO. The gear I worked for 3 years ago and progress is all still relevant. I'm 600 GS in BDO and don't really actively play. It's an odd balance. I bounce around between MMOs honestly. :)

[11:51:27] <Klaws101> Oh for sure dude. Wow is easier to play casually in the short term. But the constant borrowed power resets in wow kill all the investment. In BDO. The gear I worked for 3 years ago and progress is all still relevant. I'm 600 GS in BDO and don't really actively play. It's an odd balance. I bounce around between MMOs honestly. :)
[11:51:28] <R_A_Y_N_E> @Danoodle It depends on your goals, if you wanna test out classes see what the combat is like, just casually without trying to compete in wars or gear then yeah its kind of fun. Other wise it will take a lot and you have to sink in thousand of hours and dollars to be even in the top 5%
[11:51:28] <kystev> @Thel_1 nice essay
[11:51:31] <Jaywaah> @WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOO I played it enough, meant I obviously don't anymore. It's just sad I would've loved this game to not be a gaming casino because it's beautiful and the combat is cool

[11:58:53] <hashpipe> Helpful
[11:58:53] <BeastSky> double dash cancels it
[11:58:55] <R2Riot> the dash cancels i think
[11:58:58] <Fnjaf> think you can't dash twice before releasing
[11:58:59] <SparkyAccount> you need to keep hoklding shift
[11:58:59] <teenykappy> you can dash once with it
[11:59:01] <Lyraei> onle one dash
[11:59:02] <Rapaelski> Dash once, not twice
[11:59:02] <KaiZeeKing> onlly once
[11:59:04] <SparkyAccount> at the end keep holding shift
[11:59:07] <kartoonkiller> need to fully charge it
[11:59:07] <TigerGER> you can only make 1 jump
[11:59:07] <Lyraei> maybe
[11:59:08] <LushHigh> !followage
[11:59:09] <KingPessimist> you need fully charged it

[11:59:15] <lHuskyy> @sodapoppin Must be fully charged
[11:59:16] <jstep__> no you can dash as many times as you want, you have to fully charge it
[11:59:17] <Stratisfied> just gotta charge
[11:59:17] <MaddPikachu> understand nothing of the game, what classes are they playing as?
[11:59:20] <razatiger23> @uzi_viii probably BDO but it‚Äôs a different kind of grind

[13:06:05] <FrigoloTV> Bdo is like a poorly balance less competitive blade and soul game
[13:06:11] <HiDensity> this is honestly the result 95% of players would have vs Mac on Sorc
[13:06:12] <vellialx> ppHop
[13:06:12] <ashik45> use Q block and wait for him to attack ...after the attack just do the cc
[13:06:15] <sinisgood> you have to catch sorcs between animations

[13:06:27] <Ultramerican> @FrigoloTV what do you mean? the balance is the best it's ever been, every class can take any other class
[13:06:27] <Snaith> @stylos_ yes literally that. all pvp is two players dashing around spamming super armors and i-frames. and the person who wins is the class that has like guarded ccs.
